## Overview

Jugg Club is a streetwear brand based in Austin, TX, that needed a fresh, creative identity to resonate with its audience. The project involved designing a custom logo, apparel line (featuring t-shirts and a five-panel embroidered hat), and a set of promotional stickers. The brand identity aimed to capture the youthful and dynamic essence of Austin's vibrant street culture, with a focus on bold, minimalist designs. 

## Key Features

- **Brand Identity & Logo Design**: Created a modern and sleek logo that reflects the bold and stylish ethos of Jugg Club, with a clear focus on visual simplicity and recognizability.
- **Apparel Design**: Designed custom male and female t-shirts that showcase the brand's signature designs. The five-panel embroidered hat was developed with unique logo placement and attention to detail.
- **Stickers**: Developed a range of stickers that align with the brand's aesthetic, ideal for street marketing and promotional activities.
- **Promotional Video**: Produced a video to highlight the brand's unique designs and culture. The video was used on social media platforms to boost brand awareness and engage the target audience.

## Technologies Used

- **Adobe Creative Cloud**: 
  - **Illustrator**: For vector-based logo and apparel designs.
  - **After Effects** & **Premiere Pro**: For creating engaging promotional videos and animations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was designing apparel that appealed to a diverse audience, balancing modern streetwear aesthetics with functionality. The integration of both digital and physical assets (like stickers and hats) into a cohesive marketing strategy was crucial for building brand awareness. Another challenge was ensuring that the video content was optimized for social media platforms, creating both a visually engaging and shareable promotional tool.

## Outcome

The branding and design work for Jugg Club established a strong and memorable identity, helping the brand to successfully launch and sell its apparel. The custom t-shirt designs, hats, and stickers became key elements in promoting the brand both online and in physical spaces, and the promotional video played a significant role in driving engagement. The efforts have contributed to Jugg Clubâ€™s presence in the Austin streetwear scene and provided them with a solid foundation for future growth.
