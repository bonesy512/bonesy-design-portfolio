## Overview

Paper Route Extracts is a cannabis brand based in Colorado, creating products that pay tribute to the memory and legacy of Young Dolph. As part of this tribute, I was tasked with designing a custom logo and a label for their rosin jar, commemorating the late rapper's influence on both the cannabis and music industries. 

The goal was to create a memorable, street-inspired design that reflected Young Dolph’s bold persona while staying true to the high-quality cannabis offerings of Paper Route Extracts.

## Key Features

- **Logo Design**: Created a custom logo for Paper Route Extracts that captures the essence of Young Dolph’s brand and legacy. The logo is bold, impactful, and easily recognizable, with design elements that reflect the premium nature of the cannabis brand.
- **Rosin Jar Label**: Designed a distinctive label for the rosin jar, incorporating elements from the brand's visual identity and emphasizing the artisanal, high-end quality of the product. The label was designed to stand out on shelves while maintaining a tribute to Young Dolph's legacy.
- **Tribute Design**: The design elements of both the logo and label subtly incorporate motifs that reflect Young Dolph's style and culture, connecting the cannabis product with his legacy and fanbase.

## Technologies Used

- **Adobe Illustrator**: Used for designing the custom logo and creating vector-based assets for the rosin jar label.
- **Adobe Photoshop**: Used for editing and refining images for the rosin jar label design.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the challenges was balancing the need for a bold, street-inspired design with the necessity of maintaining a premium look for the rosin jar product. It was crucial to create something that both honored Young Dolph’s memory and appealed to cannabis consumers looking for high-quality products. 

Additionally, ensuring that the label design would work across various formats, including physical jars and digital platforms, required attention to detail in the design process. 

## Outcome

The logo and rosin jar label were well-received, successfully tying Paper Route Extracts’ cannabis offerings to Young Dolph's powerful legacy. The branding made a strong impact both on social media and in stores, helping to differentiate the brand in a competitive market.

The project was a meaningful tribute to Young Dolph, blending his influence with the quality products offered by Paper Route Extracts, creating an emotional connection with his fanbase while appealing to cannabis enthusiasts.
