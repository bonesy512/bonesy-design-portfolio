## Overview

Rooftop Restoration is a roofing and restoration company owned by Anthony Gaona. Known for delivering reliable roofing services, the company needed a strong and cohesive visual identity. I was commissioned to design a professional logo that embodied trust and durability, as well as a striking vinyl wrap for a Dodge 2500 truck to serve as a mobile advertisement and brand ambassador.

## Key Features

- **Logo Design**: Created a clean and professional logo that symbolizes strength, reliability, and protection. The design incorporates elements that evoke a sense of roofing expertise and restoration services.
- **Vehicle Vinyl Wrap Design**: Designed a bold and attention-grabbing vinyl wrap for a Dodge 2500. The wrap was tailored to showcase the brand prominently and included essential contact information, ensuring high visibility on the road.
- **Brand Cohesion**: Ensured the logo and vehicle wrap worked together seamlessly to establish a cohesive visual identity across all marketing platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Adobe Illustrator**: For crafting the scalable and detailed logo design.
- **Adobe Photoshop**: For creating realistic mockups of the vehicle wrap to present to the client.
- **Vehicle Wrap Templates**: Used to ensure precise measurements and alignment during the design process.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was creating a design for the vinyl wrap that balanced visual impact with practicality, ensuring legibility of the text and graphics even at a distance. This project reinforced the importance of combining bold aesthetics with functional design to achieve effective branding.

## Outcome

The completed logo and Dodge 2500 vinyl wrap successfully enhanced Rooftop Restoration’s brand presence. The logo became a key part of the company’s identity, while the vehicle wrap served as a mobile marketing tool, attracting attention and generating leads in the local community. Anthony Gaona expressed satisfaction with the cohesive and professional branding, which has helped solidify the company’s reputation in the industry.
