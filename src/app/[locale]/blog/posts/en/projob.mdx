Redesigning ProJob’s website to create a centralized hub for its staffing brands was a project that combined strategy, design, and technical execution to elevate the user experience. This was more than a simple website refresh—it was about bringing together multiple brands under a unified digital presence while maintaining their individuality.

## The Scope of the Project

ProJob is a national staffing agency that operates several subsidiary brands: **Sterling Hires**, **MedMasa**, **Star-1**, and **Advanced Staffing Associates**. The challenge was to redesign and integrate these brands into a centralized parent hub that would simplify navigation, improve online visibility, and enhance the overall user experience.

Working alongside **Mark Hampton** and **Patricia Pritchett**, we developed a comprehensive plan that included wireframes, brand integration, and website development. The result was a cohesive, modern design that elevated the ProJob network’s digital presence.

## Designing the ProJob Hub

The first step was to design a centralized hub for ProJob. This parent website serves as the main entry point for users, with intuitive navigation to each subsidiary brand. By combining updated branding elements with a streamlined layout, we created a professional and user-friendly experience that aligned with ProJob’s mission.

        },

## Integrating Subsidiary Brands

Each subsidiary brand—Sterling Hires, MedMasa, Star-1, and Advanced Staffing Associates—had its own identity and target audience. We ensured these individual brands retained their uniqueness while aligning them with the overarching ProJob aesthetic. This included consistent use of typography, color palettes, and branding elements across all sites.

## Key Features of the Redesign

- **Responsive Web Design**: Ensured the website was mobile-friendly and accessible on all devices, catering to the needs of job seekers and employers alike.
- **Job Search Functionality**: Added advanced filtering options to the job search feature, allowing users to find positions quickly and efficiently.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implemented SEO strategies to boost online visibility and drive traffic to the site.
- **Call-to-Action Sections**: Designed prominent CTAs on the ProJob hub to encourage users to explore subsidiary websites.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges was balancing the distinct identities of the subsidiary brands with the cohesive feel of the ProJob hub. We addressed this by creating flexible design templates that could be tailored to each brand while maintaining consistency. Another challenge was integrating job search functionality seamlessly across all sites, which required close collaboration with the development team to ensure usability.

## Technologies Used

- **WordPress**: Powered the ProJob and subsidiary websites, providing a scalable content management system.
- **GoDaddy**: Used for domain registration and hosting to ensure reliable performance.
- **Divi Theme by Elegant Themes**: Enabled rapid customization and responsive design across multiple pages.
- **Google Analytics**: Monitored site performance and user behavior to refine the user experience.

## The Outcome

The redesigned ProJob hub and its subsidiary websites successfully unified the staffing agency’s digital presence. The centralized hub improved navigation and branding consistency, while the individual websites retained their unique appeal. The enhanced job search functionality and responsive design made it easier for job seekers to connect with opportunities, resulting in increased engagement and leads.

## Collaboration and Gratitude

This project was a collaborative effort with **Mark Hampton** and **Patricia Pritchett**, whose insights and expertise were instrumental in its success. Working together allowed us to deliver a website that met ProJob’s goals while setting a new standard for user experience in the staffing industry.

## Looking Ahead

The ProJob redesign is a testament to the power of thoughtful design and collaboration. It’s projects like this that inspire me to keep pushing boundaries and finding creative solutions. I’m excited for the next opportunity to create meaningful digital experiences that make a difference.

Thank you for being part of this journey, and here’s to more impactful projects in the future!
